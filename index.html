        <section class="intro">
            <p>I design products with depth, working deeply through problems, prototyping extensively, 
                crafting interfaces that feel right with love and intention.</p>

            <p>I've learned that doing a few things <em>exceptionally well</em> matters more than doing many things adequately.</p>

            <p>My <a href="work.html">works</a> show how I solve real problems through careful research, 
                thoughtful and iterative design, and detailed prototyping. I also make personal explorations for curiosity and craft, 
                and I <a href="letters.html">write</a> about my journey through design, my love for the practice, 
                and building a sustainable creative life.</p>

            <p>I'm currently looking for my next role as a product designer. 
                I'm interested in working with teams that value thoughtfulness over speed and timeless craft over trends.</p>
