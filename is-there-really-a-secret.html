            <p>This tweet appeared on my timeline like a confession disguised as a question: "Designers who juggle 9-5, freelance AND keep Instagram, LinkedIn & TikTok alive... Drop the secret sauce üôè"
             
            
            <p>
                Fourteen thousand people saw themselves in it.

                I felt something else ‚Äî a deep, specific dread.

                Not at the person asking. They're just trying to survive in a system that demands we fragment ourselves into productivity. 
                But at the premise itself, sitting there unquestioned: that this is simply what we must do now. Work full-time. Hustle on the side. Feed the platforms. Keep the personal brand alive. Optimize every hour. 
                The question isn't "should we?" but "how do we do it better?"
            </p>
            
            <p>What if the secret they're looking for doesn't exist? What if the real question is: why are we accepting this as the baseline for a life?</p>
